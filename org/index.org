Name in Devanagari: वैभव कर्वे \nbsp{}\nbsp{} Name in IPA: ʋəibʱəʋə kərʋeː

I am a PhD student at the [[https://math.illinois.edu][Department of Mathematics]] at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  My PhD advisor is [[https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hirani/][Anil
Hirani]].

My research interests lie in graph theory, logic, algorithms and
computational topology.  I am currently writing my doctoral thesis,
titled /Graphical structure of unsatisfiable boolean formulae/ which
combines the tools of graph theory and topology to analyze boolean
satisfiability -- a classic problem in logic and computer science.

I am also looking to extend my doctoral work towards the upcoming and
adjacent field of computer-assisted formalized mathematics and
interactive theorem proving (in particular, with the Lean theorem prover).
