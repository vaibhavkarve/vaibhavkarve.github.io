* German has only 1 present tense
/ich sage/ is equivalent to all 3 of these English forms --
- I say
- I am saying
- I do say

* Present tense
** Usually
- Drop the *-en* or *-n* from the infinitive (root verb)
- Then add the personal endings *-e*, *-(e)st*, *(e)t*, *‚Äìen*, *-(e)t*, *‚Äìen*) to the
  remaining infinitive stem.

** To be = /sein/ (irregular verb)
The verb /sein/'s table is irregular. Commonly used, so just memorize it.

** Regular verb examples
Below are verb tables for regular verbs. Each table is very similar, with
only slight differences due to last letter of root verb.

*** /gehen/ = to go
| Person       | Eng (Sing.)   | Eng (Plu.) | German (Sing.) | German (Plu.) |
|--------------+---------------+------------+----------------+---------------|
| 1st          | I ...         | We ...     | /ich gehe/       | /wir gehen/     |
| 2nd          | You ...       | You ...    | /du gehst/       | /ihr geht/      |
| 3rd          | He/She/It ... | They ...   | /er/sie/es geht/ | /sie gehen/     |
| 3rd & Polite | He/She/It ... | They ...   | /Sie gehen/      | /Sie gehen/     |

*** /sitzen/ = to sit
| Person       | Eng (Sing.)   | Eng (Plu.) | German (Sing.)  | German (Plu.) |
|--------------+---------------+------------+-----------------+---------------|
| 1st          | I ...         | We ...     | /ich sitze/       | /wir sitzen/    |
| 2nd          | You ...       | You ...    | /du sitzt*/       | /ihr sitzt/     |
| 3rd          | He/She/It ... | They ...   | /er/sie/es sitzt/ | /sie sitzen/    |
| 3rd & Polite | He/She/It ... | They ...   | /Sie sitzen/      | /Sie sitzen/    |

 * = if the infinitive stem ends in *-s*, *-√ü*, *-x*, or *-z*, then the *-s* in
 *du*-ending is omitted.

Other exaples of this:
- /du faxt/ = you are faxing (still? Really?)
- /du gie√üt/ = you are pouring (üç∫?)

*** /finden/ = to find
| Person       | Eng (Sing.)   | Eng (Plu.) | German (Sing.)   | German (Plu.) |
|--------------+---------------+------------+------------------+---------------|
| 1st          | I ...         | We ...     | /ich finde/        | /wir finden/    |
| 2nd          | You ...       | You ...    | /du findest/       | /ihr findet/    |
| 3rd          | He/She/It ... | They ...   | /er/sie/es findet/ | /sie finden/    |
| 3rd & Polite | He/She/It ... | They ...   | /Sie finden/       | /Sie finden/    |

A bunch of extra "e"s are inserted in the table above since the verb ends
in /d/t/, making the words easier to pronounce.

Other examples of this:
- /du arbeitest/ = you work
- /er arbeitet/ = he works
- /ihr arbeitet/ = you (all) work
- /du √∂ffnest/ = you open
- /er √∂ffnet/ = he opens
- /ihr √∂ffnet/ = you (all) open

*** /handeln/ = to act
| Person       | Eng (Sing.)   | Eng (Plu.) | German (Sing.)    | German (Plu.) |
|--------------+---------------+------------+-------------------+---------------|
| 1st          | I ...         | We ...     | /ich handele/       | /wir handeln*/  |
| 2nd          | You ...       | You ...    | /du handelst/       | /ihr handelt/   |
| 3rd          | He/She/It ... | They ...   | /er/sie/es handelt/ | /sie handeln*/  |
| 3rd & Polite | He/She/It ... | They ...   | /Sie handeln*/      | /Sie handeln*/  |

 * = infinitive root ends in just *-n* instead of *-en*. Therefore, the
   wir/sie/Sie forms end in *-n*.

Other examples of this:
- /wir √§ndern/ = we change
- /Sie √§ndern/ = they change
