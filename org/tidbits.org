This is just a list of facts/definitions that didn't fit elsewhere.


* Homotopy
** Massey triple product
 If [Œ±]‚¨ù[Œ≤] = 0 ‚áí Œ±‚¨ùŒ≤ = dœÉ.
 If [Œ≤]‚¨ù[Œ≥] = 0 ‚áí Œ≤‚¨ùŒ≥ = dœÑ.
 Then define the triple product with
 ‚ü®Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥‚ü© = [œÉ‚¨ùŒ≥ - Œ±‚¨ùœÑ]

- Keywords :: Operads, A_‚àû, E_‚àû. "More associative than (associative)
              rings. More commutative than commutative rings."

* Graph theory
Plabic graphs := planar bicolorable graphs.

* Quantum computing
** PAC learning model
- concept ‚â° feature; c : X ‚Üí {0, 1}
- concept class ‚â° collection of features
- labelled examples (x, c(x))
- x ~ D, distribution on X
- given t samples (x·µ¢, c(x·µ¢)), i ‚àà [t], compute with probability ‚â•
  1-Œ¥, hypothesis c' such that Pr_{x~D}(c'(x) = c(x)) ‚â• 1-Œµ.
- Interesting question to ask is what should be the size of t in terms
  of Œµ and Œ¥?

_Note:_ a quantum version of sampling this distribution will look
like (assuming X is discrete):
$$|œà\rangle = \sum_x \alpha_x |x, c(x)\rangle,$$
where $\alpha_x = \sqrt{D(x)}$.

* Stern sequence
  Bruce Reznick has some notes on these at [[https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~reznick/595-ch1.pdf][link]].

* Hypertrees
    - wiki :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertree

A _hypertree_ is a hypergraph whose _host graph_ is a tree. Equivalently, h is a
hypertree if ‚àÉ a tree t such that ‚àÄ e ‚àà h there is a corresponding subtree of t
having the same vertex set as e.

A connected graph g is a _host graph_ of a connected hypergraph h if every
hyperedge of h induces a connected subgraph in g.

As far as I can see, it is not very east to check if a hypergraph is a
hypertree. However, there seem to be some equivalent
graph-property-testing definitions for answering this question that
are faster to check.
* Circle packings
** Circle packing -- a mathematical tale by Kenneth Stephenson
- Type :: article
- Reference :: https://www.math.utk.edu/~kens/Notices_article.pdf
- Key idea :: Triangulation ‚Üí Circle packing ‚Üí Conformal mapping ‚Üí
              metric ‚Üí geometry
- Source :: This was communicated to Hirani by Nathan.
*** Triangulations ‚Üí Circle packing
- Original idea :: from Thurston's "Note"

The packing is a configuration of circles that are tangent to one
another.

Moreover, this packing is unique up to M√∂bius transformations and
inversions of the sphere.

*** Circle packing (combinatorial data) ‚Üí Conformal mapping (geometric data)
- Original idea :: "A finite Riemann mapping theorem", a talk by
                   Thurston

*** Setup
- Notation ::
  - $\mathbb{P}$ :: the sphere
  - ‚ÑÇ :: the euclidean plane
  - $\mathbb{D}$ :: the unit disc

_Complex:_ the tangency patterns for circle packings are encoded as
abstract simplicial 2-complexes K. Assume K triangulates an
oriented topological surface. (In Graphsat, these complexes are
Hypergraphs).

_(Circle) Packing:_ a packing P for K is a configuration of
circles such that,
- ‚àÄ (v : Vertex) ‚àà K, ‚àÉ (c_v : Circle) such that
- ‚àÄ (‚ü®v, u‚ü© : Edge) ‚àà K, c_v and c_u are externally tangent.
- ‚àÄ (‚ü®v, u, w‚ü©: Positively-Oriented-Face) ‚àà K, ‚ü®c_v, c_u, c_w‚ü© are
  positively-oriented-triple-of-tangent-circles.

_Label:_ A label R of K is a map of Vertex ‚Üí ‚Ñù given by v ‚Ü¶
radius(c_v).

The drawing can be constructed once we know K and R. The position of
the vertices is not important, only the adjacencies in K matter. R
needs to be computed.

*** Computing the labels
1. _Flower:_ a circle surrounding by its tangent circles. The "petals"
   form an oriented chain of tangent circles. The chain is closed iff
   the original circle is centered at an internal vertex of K.
2. _Angle sum:_ Œ∏_R(v) is the sum of all angles incident at the vertex
   from the petals surrounding it. On other words, the sum is over all
   faces that are incident at v.
3. _Packing condition:_ for an interior vertex, the sum must add up to
   some positive multiple of 2œÄ.

If K is simply connected, then the packing condition suffices to
guarantee a packing. If not simply connected, then "global
obstructions" become important.

4. _Univalent packing_: ?? This part is unclear. Something to do local
   vs. global. ??
*** Note
    I did not understand the rest of the article. ü§∑
** Circle Packing theorem
- wiki :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing_theorem
- related to :: circle packing
- also called :: Koebe-Andreev-Thurston theorem

The interiors of a circle packing must be disjoint.

_Circle packing theorem:_ For every connected simple planar graph G there is a
circle packing in the plane whose intersection graph is (isomorphic to) G.

_Koebe-Andreev-Thurston theorem:_ If G is a finite maximal planar graph, then
the circle packing whose tangency graph is isomorphic to G is unique, up to
M√∂bius transformations and reflections in lines.

A _conformal map_ between two open sets in the plane or in a higher-dimensional
space is a continuous function from one set to the other that preserves the
angles between any two curves. The _Riemann mapping theorem_, formulated by
Bernhard Riemann in 1851, states that, for any two open topological disks in the
plane, there is a conformal map from one disk to the other.

Thurston used circle packings to find a conformal mapping from an arbitrary open
disk A to the interior of a circle. The mapping from one topological disk A to
another disk B could then be found by composing the map from A to a circle with
the inverse of the map from B to a circle.
** Enumeration of triangulations of the disc by William G. Brown
 - ref :: Enumeration of triangulations of the disk by William G. Brown (paper)

 A triangulation of type [n, m] of a disc is a polyhedron Œ© having (m+3) exterior
 vertices and n interior vertices. Extrior edges are edges that have both
 vertices exterior.

 I checked [n, 0] triangulations.
 They are always satisfiable for n ‚â§ 4.
