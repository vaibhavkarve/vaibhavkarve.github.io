* Basic concepts
Syntax and semantics of expressions → first-order logic (FOL) → theory and
metatheory of FOL.

Expressions of FOL := terms and formulas.

Terms := variables | constant-symbols | function-symbols.

Formulas := predicate-symbols and terms (combined recursively using logical
connectives and quantifiers).

Semantics deals with the concept of satisfaction in a structure. Using
satisfiability, it then defines other notions like validity and entailment.

* First-order languages


* Structures and theories
A /structure/ is a set that we wish to study equipped with collection
of distinguished functions, relations, and elements. We also choose a
/language/ (which is a set of symbols) to express statements about the
structure.

A /language/ \(\mathcal{L}\) is given by specifying the following data:
- \(F\) := a set of function symbols
- \(n_f : \mathbb{N}\) for every \(f \in F\) i.e., the /arity/ of each function.
- \(R\) := a set of relation symbols
- \(n_r : \mathbb{N}\) for every \(r \in R\) i.e., the /arity/ of each relation.
- \(C\) := a set of constant symbols.

Examples of languages:
1. Language of groups = \(\{\cdot, e\}\).
2. Language of rings = \(\{+, -, \cdot, 0, 1\}\).
3. Language of pure sets = \(\emptyset\).\\
4. Language of graphs = \(\{R\}\), where \(R\) is a binary relation symbol.

An \(\mathcal{L}\)-/structure/ \(\mathcal{M}\) is given by the following data:
1. \(M\) := a nonempty set called the universe, domain, or underlying
   set of \(\mathcal{M}\).
2. an interpretation of each \(f\in F\) i.e., a function
   \(f^\mathcal{M} : M^{n_f} \rightarrow M\) for each \(f\).
3. an interpretation for each \(r \in R\) i.e, a set
   \(R^\mathcal{M}\subseteq M^{n_r}\) for each \(r\).
4. an element \(c^\mathcal{M} \in M\) for each \(c\in C\).
