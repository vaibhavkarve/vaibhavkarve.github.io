* Definitions
** SAT
   We pick a countable set and call it our set of variables.

   A boolean *literal* is a variable or its negation such that we can
   assign boolean values to it each variable.

   A boolean formula is said to be in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
   if it is the conjunction of disjunctions of boolean literals.

   A CNF is /satisfiable/ if there exists a truth assignment that
   satisfies it.  Otherwise it is /unsatisfiable/.

** $\pi: CNFs \rightarrow Graphs$
   For every CNF we define a multi-hypergraph by erasing all negating
   and then treating clauses as hyperedges and conjunctions as the
   graph join operation. We denote this projection map by $\pi$.

   Example:
   \[(a\vee \neg b) \wedge (b \vee \neg c)
     \wedge (\neg a \vee \neg c)\wedge d \longmapsto (ab),(bc),(ac),(d)\]
   
   Here, $(d)$ should be interpreted as a loop at the vertex d.
 
   Table summarizing the effect of $\pi$:
   | Concepts in the CNF world | Concepts in the Graph world |
   |---------------------------+-----------------------------|
   | Variables                 | Vertices                    |
   | Literals                  | Vertices                    |
   | Clauses                   | (hyper)Edges                |
   | 1-SAT clause              | Loop                        |
   | 2-SAT clause              | Simple edge                 |
   | 3-SAT clause              | Hyperedge                   |
   | CNF                       | Multi-hypergraph            |

** Graphsat
   A multi-hypergraph $G$ is /satisfiable/ if the set $\pi^{-1}(G)$
   is nonempty and every element of $\pi^{-1}(G)$ is
   satisfiable. Otherwise it is unsatisfiable.

* In Lean
  I have formalized the definition of graph satisfiability in Lean.  I
  am working on project called ~leansat~ formalizing some of my 2-sat
  results in Lean.

* In Python
  I have created a python3.8 package called ~graphsat~ that can perform computations on
  graphs, multi-graphs, hypergraphs and multi-hypergraphs as well as
  on CNFs.  The package is unpublished as of now.  I use it for all my
  experimentation and computation.

* In Haskell
  I am attempting to translate ~graphsat~ in Haskell as well. This is
  still a work in progress.
