Since this note concerns a programming language, it is important to keep
track of when this note was last updated.
- Python version :: These notes use v3.9.2 and were last updated in March 2021.
- Python documentation and reference on which these notes are based :: → [[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html][Data model]]


* Objects
/Objects/ are python's abstraction of data. All data is stored as objects. All
code is also represented by objects.

#+begin_center
=Object = (Identity, Type, Value)=
#+end_center
1. The identity can be though of as an object's location in memory. =id()= gives
   the identity (or memory address) of an object as an integer, while =is=
   operator compares identities of two objects.
2. The type determines the operations supported by an object, as well possible
   values for that object.
3. The value is the data stored-in/referenced-by an object.
   - an object is immutable if it value cannot be changed. E.g. numbers,
     strings, tuples.
   - an object is mutable if it can be. E.g. dicts, lists.

** Containers
A /container/ is an object that contains references to another object.

*Note:* an immutable container of mutable objects is still considered
immutable! E.g. =frozenset[list[int]]=
