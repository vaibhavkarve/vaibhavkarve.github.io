* Objects
/Objects/ are python's abstraction of data. All data is stored as objects. All
code is also represented by objects.

#+begin_center
=Object = (Identity, Type, Value)=
#+end_center
1. The identity can be though of as an object's location in memory. =id()= gives
   the identity (or memory address) of an object as an integer, while =is=
   operator compares identities of two objects.
2. The type determines the operations supported by an object, as well possible
   values for that object.
