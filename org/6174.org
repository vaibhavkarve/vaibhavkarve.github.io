* Kaprekar's Process
1. Pick a 4-digit number, using at least two different digits.
2. Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get
   two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if
   necessary.
3. Subtract the smaller #number from the bigger number.
4. Go back to
   step 2. and repeat.

The above process will always reach its fixed point, 6174. Thus spake
D.R.Kaprekar (1905-1986) -- school teacher, recreational number
theorist and Indian mathematician.

I have created a visual graph of this process. Every four-digit number
is a point on one of the circles. Every iteration outlined by Kaprekar
is a path. His algorithm might be mechanical but the patterns emerging
from it are anything but. At the center is the number =6174=
(indicated by the red dot) to which all others are inexorably
drawn. This plot itself was generated algorithmically using a
combination of Python, TikZ, and $\LaTeX$.


* TODO Port code from TikZ to Lua
