This work presents a new method to quantify connectivity in
transportation networks. Inspired by the field of topological data
analysis, we propose a novel approach to explore the robustness of
road network connectivity in the presence of congestion on the
roadway. The robustness of the pattern is summarized in a congestion
barcode, which can be constructed directly from traffic datasets
commonly used for navigation. As an initial demonstration, we
illustrate the main technique on a publicly available traffic dataset
in a neighborhood in New York City.
